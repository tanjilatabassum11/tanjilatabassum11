Hello there 👋

I’m a software developer and a dedicated, highly motivated Computer Science and Engineering graduate, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics. I bring a strong retail background that has sharpened my customer service, communication, and problem-solving skills.

I am skilled in translating real-world customer challenges into effective technical solutions and continuously expanding my coding and data expertise to build innovative, user-focused technology. I am actively seeking opportunities where I can blend my technical knowledge, data-driven thinking, and customer-centric approach as a software developer or data-focused professional.
